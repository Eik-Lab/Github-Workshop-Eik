## Introduction to Git and GitHub

Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes in files over time. GitHub is a platform for collaboration and sharing Git repositories. In this workshop, you will learn how to use Git to manage project history and how to collaborate on GitHub.

## Installation

Before we begin, make sure Git is installed on your computer. You can download Git from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/) and follow the instructions for your platform.

### Windows
    To check if Git is installed, open a terminal window and run the following command:
    ```bash
        git --version
    ```
    If Git is installed, you will see the version number. If not, you can follow the instructions at [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win) to install Git.

### macOS
    To check if Git is installed, open a terminal window and run the following command:
    ```bash
        git --version
    ```
    If Git is installed, you will see the version number. If not, you can follow the instructions at [https://git-scm.com/download/mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) to install Git.

## Basic Concepts

- **Repository**: A place where project files and history are stored.
- **Commit**: A snapshot of changes in your project files.
- **Branch**: A fork of the project that allows you to work on new features or changes in isolation.
- **Merge**: Incorporating changes from one branch into another.
- **Pull Request**: A request to merge changes from one branch to another (especially on GitHub).

## Commands

Some basic commands you will learn include:

- `git clone`: Clone an existing repository to your computer.
- `git add`: Add changes to the staging area, ready to be committed.
- `git commit`: Save a snapshot of your changes.
- `git pull`: Fetch changes from a remote repository to your local repository.
- `git push`: Send your local changes to a remote repository.
- `git branch`: View, create, or delete branches in the project.
- `git merge`: Incorporate changes from one branch into another.

## Workflow

1. Clone a repository to your computer.
2. Create a branch for a new feature.
3. Make changes to the files and commit them.
4. Push the branch to GitHub.
5. Create a Pull Request to propose the changes to the main branch.
6. Discuss the changes, make necessary adjustments, and mark it as ready for merge.
7. Perform a merge to integrate the changes into the main branch.

## Collaboration

GitHub provides easy collaboration options:

- Follow a repository to track the project's development.
- Create Issues to track tasks, bugs, and requests.
- Contribute to a project by cloning, modifying, and proposing changes through Pull Requests.
- Use Pull Request discussions to discuss changes before merging.
